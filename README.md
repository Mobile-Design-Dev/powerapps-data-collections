# Power Apps Exploration

[Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi) is a solution that allows _anyone_ to build **low-code apps** that solve real business challenges! Citizen developers can now use prebuilt templates and drag-and-drop design tools, to build _and distribute_ functioning apps for use within their organization.

Power Apps is part of the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi/) suite of products alongside three other components:

 * [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=github-0000--ninarasi) (previously called _Flow_) for workflow and business process automation
 * [Power Virtual Agents](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi) for building chatbots and conversational experiences.
 * [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi) for creating data-driven insights and sharing reporting or dashboards around it.

In this project, I hope to explore all of Power Platform through the lens of Power Apps and mobile application development. Specifically, while I may explore each of the other components, it will be done in the context of how those components or technologies support Power Apps experiences or development.
