## Random Data Sources

Power Apps help you build mobile apps in a low-code (drag and drop) development environment, but you need to have data to power those experiences. The learning paths provide a sample dataset - but it can be useful to **curate** your own dataset so you understand exactly how and where that data (and the schema) are used in the app development process.

Mock data generators (that create fake or placeholder data) are super helpful. Here are a few resources you can explore. Please check each site for their usage policies or costs. 

  * [Random Data API](https://random-data-api.com/)
  * [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com/)
  * [RandomUser.me](https://randomuser.me/)
  * [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
  * [Faker API](https://fakerapi.it/en)
  * [Dev.To Post with 20 resources](https://dev.to/iainfreestone/20-resources-for-generating-fake-and-mock-data-55g1)

Many will allow you to export the data in a format of your choosing (.CSV, .JSON, .XLS) or access it via an API, giving you various "real-world" options to explore, and workflows to setup, when building your app.
