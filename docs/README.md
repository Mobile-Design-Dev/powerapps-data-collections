# Power Apps Exploration

[Microsoft Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi) is a solution that allows _anyone_ to build **low-code apps** that solve real business challenges! Citizen developers can now use prebuilt templates and drag-and-drop design tools, to build _and distribute_ functioning apps for use within their organization.

Power Apps is part of the [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/en-us?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi/) suite of products alongside three other components:

 * [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=github-0000--ninarasi) (previously called _Flow_) for workflow and business process automation
 * [Power Virtual Agents](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi) for building chatbots and conversational experiences.
 * [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=github-0000-ninarasi) for creating data-driven insights and sharing reporting or dashboards around it.

In this project, I hope to explore all of Power Platform through the lens of Power Apps and mobile application development. Specifically, while I may explore each of the other components, it will be done in the context of how those components or technologies support Power Apps experiences or development.

Join me on my learning journey!
